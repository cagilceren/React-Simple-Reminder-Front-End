This project is created as a part of self-learning. 

In this project, I have created an user interface for a TO-DO App.

## Build With

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Tools & Technologies

- JSON
- React
- Axios

## Highlights

In this project i have used React to create UI for my REST API Reminder Projects (see: [PHP-Simple-TO-DO-List-REST-API](https://github.com/cagilceren/PHP-Simple-TO-DO-List-REST-API) and [Java-Simple-TO-DO-List-REST-API](https://github.com/cagilceren/Java-Simple-TO-DO-List-REST-API)).

I have choosed React library so that user can see on UI what he does without reloading the webpage or the app.

With the help of Axios i was able to build the communication between backend and frontent. (see: [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete))

In the case of an error i have used axios.catch() function to catch the error and inform the user.
